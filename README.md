The Daily Plan was found to increase patient safety during hospitalization. By importing provider orders into a health summary, patients receive an itinerary for each day in the hospital.It enhances and promotes communication with our patients. Involving patients and families in the health care experience can serve as a safeguard, preventing unintended mistakes and increases patient safety by engaging patients, as well as their families. It encourages them to better understand their care. These patient-specific reports, one or two pages in length, reflect current orders such as allergies, medications, procedures, and diet.
