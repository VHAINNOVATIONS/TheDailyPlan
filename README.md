TheDailyPlan
============

The Daily Plan was found to increase patient safety during hospitalization. By importing provider orders into a health summary, patients receive an itinerary for each day in the hospital. These patient-specific reports, one or two pages in length, reflect current orders such as allergies, medications, procedures, and diet.
