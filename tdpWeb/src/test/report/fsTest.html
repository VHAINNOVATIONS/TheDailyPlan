<p class="sidenote">The box <a class="pageref" href="#specs">&#8220;CSS Specifications&#8221;</a> lists the different CSS specifications.</p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) represent a major breakthrough in
how Web-page designers work by expanding their ability to
control the appearance of Web pages, which are the documents
that people publish on the Web.</p>

<p>For the first few years after the World Wide Web (the Web) was
created in 1990, people who wanted to put pages on the Web had
little control over what those pages looked like. In the
beginning, authors could only specify structural aspects of
their pages (for example, that some piece of text would be a
heading or some other piece would be straight text). Also,
there were ways to make text bold or italic, among a few other
effects, but that's where their control ended.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-web">
<h2>The Web</h2>

<p>The Web is a vast collection of documents on the <dfn
id="dfn-internet">Internet</dfn> that are linked together via
hyperlinks. The Internet consists of millions of computers worldwide
that communicate electronically. A <dfn
id="dfn-hyperlink">hyperlink</dfn> is a predefined link between two
documents. The hyperlinks allow a user to access documents on various
Web servers without concern for where they are located. A <dfn
id="dfn-web-server">Web server</dfn> is a computer on the Internet
that serves out Web pages on request. From a document on a Web server
in California, the user is just one mouse click away from a document
that is stored, perhaps, on a Web server in France. Hyperlinks are
integral to the Web. Without them, there would be no Web.</p>


<div class="section" id="development">
<h3>Development of the Web</h3>

<p>The Web was invented around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee with
Robert Cailliau as a close ally. Both of them were then
working at <dfn id="dfn-cern">CERN</dfn>, which is the European Laboratory for Particle
Physics. Tim is a graduate of Oxford University and a
long-time computer and software expert, and is now the director
of the <dfn id="dfn-w3c">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</dfn>, an organization that
coordinates the development of the Web. He also is a
principal research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence (MIT CSAIL). Robert is a 30-year veteran at
CERN, where he still works. Robert organized the
first Web conference in Geneva in 1993. Both Tim and Robert
were awarded the ACM Software System Award in 1995 because
of their work on the Web.</p>

<div class="section" id="images">
<h3>Adding images</h3>

<p>Images proliferate on the Web. It wasn't until the Mosaic browser
added support for images in 1993 that a critical mass of people
realized the potential of the Web. You can add images to your
documents with the <span class="element">img</span> element &#8211;
<span class="element">img</span> is short for image.</p>

<p>When the image is ready, the page looks like <a class="figref"
href="#fig-loaded">this figure</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig-loaded">
  <p class="caption">The image has been loaded.</p>
  <p class="art"><img alt="[image]" src="html-18.png" style="width: 100%"/></p>

<div class="chapter" id="css-h-1">
<h1>CSS</h1>

<p class="sidenote">HTML is the most popular document format on the
Web, and it is used in most of the examples in this book.</p>

<p>As we explained in <a class="chapref" href="html-h-1"><q>The Web and HTML,</q></a>
 HTML elements enable Web-page designers to
mark up a document's structure. The HTML specification lists
guidelines on how browsers should display these elements. For example,
you can be reasonably sure that the contents of a <span
class="element">strong</span> element will be displayed as boldfaced.
Also, you can pretty much trust that most browsers will display the
content of an <span class="element">h1</span> element using a big font
size &#8211; at least bigger than the <span class="element">p</span>
element and bigger than the <span class="element">h2</span> element.
But beyond trust and hope, you don't have any control over your text's
appearance.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="specs">
<h2 class="no-toc">CSS specifications</h2>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets is formally described in three W3C
specifications: CSS1, CSS2, and CSS 2.1. (As discussed in the
previous chapter, W3C is the organization that coordinates the
technical development of the Web.) The first specification, CSS1,
was issued in December 1996 and describes a simple style sheet
language mostly for screen-based presentations. CSS1 has around 50
properties (for example, <span class="property">color</span> and
<span class="property">font-size</span>). CSS2 was finalized in May
1998 and builds on CSS1. CSS2 includes all CSS1 properties and adds
around 70 of its own, such as properties to describe aural
presentations and page breaks.</p>

<p>CSS 2.1 is the most recent specification published by W3C. It
adds some new features, but CSS 2.1 is mostly a scaled-down version
of CSS2. CSS2 was an ambitious attempt to describe functionality,
which Web authors had requested. However, not all the functionality
is reliably supported by all browsers. CSS 2.1 is a specification
that describes the parts that <em>are</em> supported by two or
more browsers. Because CSS 2.1 is similar to CSS2, the
specification was given a minor version number (that is, 2.1)
rather than a major number (such as CSS3).</p>

<div class="section" id="rules">
<h2>Rules and Style Sheets</h2>

<p>You can create style sheets in two ways. You can either use a
normal text editor and write the style sheets <q>by hand</q> or you
can use a dedicated tool &#8211; for example, a Web authoring tool.
The dedicated tools enable you to create style sheets without learning
the syntax of the CSS language. However, in many cases, the designer
wants to tweak the style sheet by hand afterwards, so we recommend
that you learn to write and edit CSS by hand. Let's get started! Here
is a simple example:</p>

<pre class="CSS">
h1 { color: green }
</pre>

<p>This code is a simple CSS rule that contains one rule. A <dfn
id="dfn-rule">rule</dfn> is a statement about one stylistic aspect of
one or more elements. A <dfn id="dfn-style-sheet">style sheet</dfn> is
a set of one or more rules that apply to an HTML document. This rule
sets the color of all first-level headings (<span
class="element">h1</span>).</p>
