Running Ant tasks
- Assumption that Oracle Weblogic Server is installed in the default location: C:\Oracle\Middleware\wlserver_10.3\

Launch a command prompt

run the command: \Oracle\Middleware\wlserver_10.3\server\bin\setWLSEnv.cmd to set the environment

cd to the location where the source is installed (cd workspace\VA\tdpWeb).  Note the the shared, tdpApp and tdpWeb folders are in the same location

run the following command to correct the classpath: set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;..\shared\lib\dbunit-2.4.5.jar;..\shared\lib\slf4j-api-1.6.0.jar;..\shared\lib\slf4j-simple-1.6.0.jar

In the tdpWeb\build.properties file, ensure that the MDWS Server URL is correct, and the following SQL Server properties are set correctly:
jdbc.url=jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://localhost:1433/tdp_web
jdbc.password=tdpP@55
jdbc.username=tdp_user

Run the command 'ant reload-db' to initialize the database.  Note that the database should already exist on the server, and the SQL Server user matching the jdbc.username should have administrative privileges to create the table structure.

Running 'ant' will build an ear file that may be deployed to the Weblogic server.
