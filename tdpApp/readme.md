# angular-fullstack-ionic-starter

The motivation behind Angular Fullstack Ionic is to streamline the development of projects that include an API, Angular webapp and Ionic app. Itâ€™s core design principles include sharing code and assets wherever possible, creating an efficient workflow and making it super easy to start off a project with handy components available out of the box (e.g. user signup/login). 

It is based on the brilliant Yeoman angular-fullstack project.

##### Get started
*Note this project in the early stages - so please read the points below before jumping in!*
```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```
##### Dependencies
If you don't have it already, you'll need Sass: ```gem install sass```

You'll also need MongoDB to be up and running: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/

### Implemented so far
* Grunt development workflow to serve webapp and ionic app in two browser tabs
* Frontend (client) directory with
  * webapp - Jade, JS, SCSS and assets specific to webapp
  * ionic -  HTML, JS, SCSS and assets specific to ionic app
  * common - SCSS and assets shared between webapp and ionic app
  
### Next steps
* Wire up grunt dist tasks to work with new client folder structure
* Implement user login in Ionic app
* Implement shared components (e.g. angular directives, etc)
* Implement shared fonts
* Support plain HTML as well as Jade for webapp
* Support Jade as well as plain HTML for ionic app

### Get involved
The eventual aim of this project is to create an extension to the Yeoman generator-angular-fullstack
